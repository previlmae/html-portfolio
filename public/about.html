<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I'm Elvanice ( aka Elvie), an IT student specializing in software application development with a strong foundation in Java, 
object-oriented design, and systems thinking. 
I’m currently learning how to turn complex user needs into intuitive, scalable code—and I'm all about building solutions with real-world impact.
Whether I’m diagramming system flow with UML or coding class structures from scratch, I care about writing maintainable code and aligning software 
to business strategy.What I’ve worked on so far:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Developed a recipe management app using Java and OOAD principles</li>

  <li>Built full software lifecycle models (use case, class, and sequence diagrams) for a paper grading platform</li>

  <li>Conducted a technical audit for HYPERVSN, evaluating IT solutions for immersive display tech</li>

  <li>Analyzed operating system architecture, performance, and security to deliver optimized recommendations</li>

</ul>

<p>What I’m learning now:</p>

<ul>

  <li>Agile development methods</li>
  <li>Test-driven development</li>
  <li>Real-world debugging and code reviews</li>

</ul>

<p>My goal is to grow into a software engineer who can think like a designer, code like an architect, and deliver like a product owner. Let’s connect if you’re into building things that make sense and make an impact.</p>
